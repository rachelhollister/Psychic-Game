# Psychic-Game

Deployment Link: https://rachelhollister.github.io/Psychic-Game/

In this assignment, I created a Psychic Game. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powerd by Javascript. The psychic game functions as follows; the application randomly picks a number and the player has to guess which number the app chose. It includes for the player to "Guess what the number that the Pyschic is Thinking Of", the number of Wins calculated (the number of times the player guesses correctly), the Losses calculated (the number of times the user has guesses incorrectly), how many guesses are left, and how many guesses the player has already had. Once the player wins the wins counter is increased, and the game restarts. Once the player loses the increase on the losses counter restarts and the page refreshes.
